## üîç Workflow

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized distributions and feature correlations
- Detected and handled outliers
- Analyzed time-based consumption trends

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Extracted date/time features (hour, day, month)
- Performed categorical encoding using `get_dummies`
- Applied IQR capping to treat outliers
- Labeled time-of-day categories (morning, afternoon, evening, night)

### 3. **Feature Selection**
- Removed low-variance features
- Selected features using ANOVA F-values

### 4. **Modeling & Evaluation**
- Applied standardization
- Trained and evaluated the following models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Grid Search-optimized Decision Tree
  - Random Forest Regressor

## üîÆ Forecasting

In addition to traditional regression modeling, the project includes time series forecasting to predict future appliance energy usage. Steps include:

- Resampling and aggregating timestamped data
- Visualizing seasonal and daily patterns
- Implementing forecasting models such as:
  - Moving Average
  - Exponential Smoothing
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Evaluating forecasts with time-based cross-validation and performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE)

These forecasting models help anticipate future consumption trends and support energy optimization decisions.
